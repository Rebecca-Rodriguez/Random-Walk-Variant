# Random-Walk-Variant
For this project, I completed variations on the random walk by implementing 2 different kinds of shapes: squares and hexagons.

**Key features**:
* UI components are present and functional
* Squares positioned properly according to all size and step scale properties
* Hexagons positioned properly according to all size and step scale properties
* Buildup of color implemented based on number of “visits” to a particular location
* Steps are constrained to the drawable area if this option is turned on
* Main functionality broken into separate classes: abstract base class, and two derived classes for the square and hexagonal walks
* Reproduction of particular patterns possible with a specific random seed value
